Use two pointers point to the head and tail of the array at first respectively.  
Then, while the left pointer is on the left of right pointer, we compare the value of sum of two pointers with the target value.
We then move one of the pointer according to the result. For example, if their sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer to make the sum larger.  

public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int i = 0, j = numbers.length-1;
        while (i < j) {
            int sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];
            if (sum == target) return new int[]{i+1, j+1};
            else if(sum < target) i++;
            else j--;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
