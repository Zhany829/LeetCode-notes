Use two pointers point to 0 and the square root of c respectively. Then compare the value of those two number's square with c.
Move one of the two pointers according to the result of the comparision.
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = (int)Math.sqrt(c);
        while (i <= j) {
            int sum = i*i + j*j;
            if (sum > c) j--;
            else if(sum < c) i++;
            else return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
