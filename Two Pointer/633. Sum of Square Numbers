Use two pointers point to 0 and the square root of c respectively. Then compare the value of those two number's square with c.
Move one of the two pointers according to the result of the comparision.
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        long l = 0, r = (long)Math.sqrt(c);
        while (l <= r) {
            long power = l*l + r*r;
            if (power < c) l += 1;
            else if (power > c) r -= 1;
            else return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
